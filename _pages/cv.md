Technical Projects
======
* Deterministic Security Log Analysis and Visualization System (Paper accepted in ACM CSS 2020)
*(Instrumentation-free user-centric attack investigation system with high level semantics by JAVA)*
  * Helped to design system architecture and algorithms to extract information from system logs
  * Designed data process application, leveraged Longest Common Subsequence (**LCS**) algorithm to extract common patterns from massive log (>100Gb), and generate ready-to-use JSON file
  * Developed a website for users to upload collected logs (**Java Spring MVC**) and to visualize those logs and their semantics interactively (**Google Catapult Trace-View JavaScript frontend**)
  * Implemented Google Catapult Trace-View to visualize recorded events and their semantics
  * Built graph databases (**neo4j**) to store the graphical dependency of system events and optimized the data import time by >100 times

* Production Target Area Forecast, EQT Corporation
*(Applied scientist Intern â€“ Pattern recognition and machine learning using R)*
  * Implemented principle component analysis, multiclass classification, and regression in R to analyze multi-dimensional Giga-bytes-data (1000+ wells) for shale-gas production
  * Optimized the multivariable statistical model for exploration area prediction, reduced error by 72%
  * Trained supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNearest Neighbors, and applied regularization with measured parameters to overcome overfitting
  * Delivered 6 maps for production decision. Presented directly to the CEO and management team

* SPRING Based Web Application: Real-time Oil & Gas Production Visualization and Database (Ongoing)
*(Real-time crude oil production monitoring system using Java Spring framework)*
  * Designed and developed a full-stack web application with **Spring MVC** framework to monitor and visualize real-time oil production
  * Built data ingestion micro-service with **JSON Schema** to validate and parse raw JSON real-time data
  * Created real-time web map with **GeoLocation** and **Google Map** APIs, built event dashboard to display production information, such as coordinate, depth, temperature, well-head pressure and oil flow
  * Utilized **ElasticSearch** to provide location based search functions for users to search and sort wells
  * Implemented asynchronous system using producer-consumer pattern with **RabbitMQ** as message broker to decouple multiple requests simultaneously
  * Built non-relational database (**MongoDB**) to store production data and optimized for analytics
