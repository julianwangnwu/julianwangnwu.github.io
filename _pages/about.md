         I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University, working with <a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/sageman-brad.html" style="color: #3BB9FF">Brad Sageman</a>, <a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/jacobson-andrew.html" style="color: #3BB9FF">Andy Jacobson</a>, and <a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/hurtgen-matthew.html" style="color: #3BB9FF">Matt Hurtgen</a>. My research has been broadly in the areas of biogeochemistry and sedimentary geochemistry, with particular focus on causes of biotic turnovers, weathering feedbacks on pCO2, and stable isotope applications to palaeoclimatology and paleoceanography. I am also interested in energy sciences and education.

         I completed a M.S. degree from Penn State University, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.geosc.psu.edu/academic-faculty/arthur-michael" style="color: #3BB9FF">Mike Arthur</a>, and a B.E. degree from China University of Petroleum.

    <b> Misc </b>
    <br>
    I am fond of technology, so I keep learning new stuffs and occasionally write <a href="https://julianwangnwu.github.io/year-archive/" style="color: #3BB9FF">notes</a> about them. I like numbers and co-manage a small mutual fund (~$10M) as a hobby since 2014. I travel around the world and sometimes take <a href="https://julianwangnwu.github.io/portfolio/" style="color: #3BB9FF">photos</a>.
