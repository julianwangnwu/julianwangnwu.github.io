         I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with <a href="https://people.earth.yale.edu/profile/lidya-tarhan/about" style="color: #3BB9FF">Prof. Lidya Tarhan</a> at Yale University, where I also work closely with <a href="https://people.earth.yale.edu/profile/noah-planavsky/about" style="color: #3BB9FF">Prof. Noah Planavsky</a>         and other great researchers. I finished my Ph.D. at Northwestern University, co-advised by <a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/sageman-brad.html" style="color: #3BB9FF">Brad Sageman</a>, <a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/jacobson-andrew.html" style="color: #3BB9FF">Andy Jacobson</a>, and <a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/hurtgen-matthew.html" style="color: #3BB9FF">Matt Hurtgen</a>. My research has been broadly in the areas of biogeochemistry and sedimentary geochemistry, with particular focus on causes of biotic turnovers, weathering feedbacks on pCO2, and stable isotope applications on palaeoclimatology and paleoceanography. I am also interested in energy sciences and education.

         I completed a M.S. degree from Penn State University, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.geosc.psu.edu/academic-faculty/arthur-michael" style="color: #3BB9FF">Mike Arthur</a>, and a B.E. degree from China University of Petroleum.

    <b> Misc </b>
    <br>
    I am fond of new technologies, so I keep learning new stuff (e.g., new technical stacks, programming languages) and occasionally write <a href="https://julianwangnwu.github.io/year-archive/" style="color: #3BB9FF">notes</a> about them. I travel around the world and sometimes take <a href="https://julianwangnwu.github.io/portfolio/" style="color: #3BB9FF">photos</a>.
