         I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University, working with <a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/sageman-brad.html" style="color: #3BB9FF">Brad Sageman</a>, <a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/jacobson-andrew.html" style="color: #3BB9FF">Andy Jacobson</a>, and <a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/hurtgen-matthew.html" style="color: #3BB9FF">Matt Hurtgen</a>. My research has been broadly in the areas of biogeochemistry and sedimentary geochemistry, with particular focus on biotic turnovers, weathering processes, and stable isotope applications to palaeoclimatology and paleoceanography. I am also interested in energy sciences and education.
