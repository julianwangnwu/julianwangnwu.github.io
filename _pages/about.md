         <i> In plain language, “I analyze rocks, build models, and write stories about them.” </i>
         <br>
         I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University, working with Brad Sageman, Andy Jacobson, and Matt Hurtgen. My research has been broadly in the areas of biogeochemistry and sedimentary geochemistry, with particular focus on biotic turnovers, weathering processes, and stable isotope applications to palaeoclimatology and paleoceanography. I am also interested in energy sciences and education.

         I completed a M.S. degree from Penn State University, where I was advised by Mike Arthur, and a B.E. degree from China University of Petroleum.
