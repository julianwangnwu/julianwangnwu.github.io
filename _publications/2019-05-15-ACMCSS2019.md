Our system utilizes how a user views and interacts with the operating system through the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to track attacker's behavior and provide schematic investigation results. 


UIScope highlights
users’ perspective and represents a new paradigm of user-centric attack
investigation. Specifically, UIScope leverages users’ interaction
logs and system events to establish causal dependency between involved
system entities (e.g., compromised files, or processes), obtain
high level human-perceivable semantics (even on low level system
events), and finally build a semantics-rich causal dependence graph
