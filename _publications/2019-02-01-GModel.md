The largest mass extinction event in the Phanerozoic, known as the end-Permian mass extinction (or EPME, ca. 252 Ma) is coincident with the main eruption phase of Siberian Traps volcanism (ca. 252 to 250 Ma). This volcanism is estimated to have a volume larger than 2Ã—10^6 km3, and can release both mantle carbon dioxide (CO2) through extrusions and thermogenic methane (CH4) and CO2 through intrusions into the atmosphere. The climatic consequences of these greenhouse gases is devastating to both marine and terrestrial lives and delay the recovery of ecosystems after the extinction.

Quantitatively, the amount of CO2 released can be estimated using global carbon cycle model (GENIE) integrated with different proxies with varying time resolution. Our model simulations suggest that lethally hot temperature, excessive nutrient load in the ocean, and decreased strength of meridional overturning circulation, along with ocean acidification in a poorly buffered ocean, potentially triggered by the Siberian Traps LIP, worked together to create the most severe bio crisis and delayed recovery in the Earth history.
