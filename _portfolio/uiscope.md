Our system utilizes how a user views and interacts with the operating system through the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to track attacker's behavior and provide schematic investigation results. Our system represents a new paradigm of user-centric attack investigation by highlighting activities from usersâ€™ perspective. Specifically, it leverages users interaction logs and system events to establish the dependency between involved system entities (e.g., compromised files, or processes), obtain high level human-perceivable semantics (both on GUI and low-level system events), and establish a causal dependence graph.
